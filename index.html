  	<p>My name is Elizabeth A. Lane and I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Political Science, in the School of Public and International Affairs at North Carolina State University..  </p>
  	
  	<p>My primary research interests center on the U.S. judiciary, with a particular emphasis on the U.S. Supreme Court. I seek to understand how the preferences, behavior, and identity characteristics of extra-judicial actors, such as attorneys, and other political leaders, influence two distinct yet related aspects of the judiciary: judicial decision making and public perceptions and evaluations.</p>
  
  	<p>My work has been funded by the National Science Foundation and the American Political Science Association and is forthcoming in the <i>American Journal of Political Science</i>, and has appeared in the <i>Journal of Politics</i>, the <i>British Journal of Political Science</i>, <i>Political Research Quarterly</i>, <i>Political Behavior</i>, <i>American Politics Research</i>, and the <i>Journal of Law and Courts</i>.</p>
  	
	<p>Outside of work, I am an avid sports fan.  I like to watch golf, I also love to watch football and basketball while rooting on the Michigan State Spartans (Go Green!) and New England Patriots.  In my spare time I also enjoy playing golf, rowing, hiking, and reading on the couch with my cats, Winston and Higgins.</p>
