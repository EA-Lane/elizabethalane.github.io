  	<p>I am an assistant professor of international relations and statistical methodolody at Indiana University Bloomington. Before joining IU, I was a political scientist at the RAND Corporation, where I worked in the National Security Research Division.</p>
  	
  	<p>My substantive research broadly focuses on how armed actors involved in civil conflicts manage their relationships with non-combatants. I am particularly interested in how these groups use different forms of media and their effect on civilian attitudes. At RAND, my work primarily focused on the assessment of emerging technologies, with a special emphasis on artificial intelligence (AI) and its implications for national security.</p>
  
  	<p>I earned my PhD in Political Science from Michigan State University and completed a Postdoctoral Fellowship at the Institute for Public Policy and Social Research. My research has been published in or accepted at the <i>Journal of Politics</i>, <i>International Studies Quarterly</i>, <i>Political Behavior</i>, <i>International Interactions</i>, and <i>Civil Wars</i>.</p>
