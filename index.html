  	<p>My name is Jonathan M. King and I am an Assistant Professor in Political Science at West Virginia University. Prior to joining WVU in 2023, I earned my Ph.D. at Michigan State University.</p>
  	
  	<p>My research interests are in American political institutions, particularly the federal judiciary. In my work, I examine 1) who is selected to become federal judges and the dynamics that influence the confirmation process and 2) how interactions between judges or justices influence judicial decision-making and the public's reaction to judicial outcomes. My research has been published in <i>Political Research Quarterly<i>,  the <i>Journal of Law and Courts<i>, <i>Justice System Journal<i>, <i>Presidential Studies Quarterly<i>, and has been supported by National Science Foundation Collaborative Research and Dissertation Improvement grants.</p>
  
  	<p>My teaching focuses on the judiciary and law and quantitative research methods. Specifically, I teach courses on judicial politics, constitutional law, and law and society, and have taught introductory quantitative methods courses in the past. On top of teaching, I love working with undergraduate and graduate students on independent research projects.</p>
  	
	<p> Prior to attending graduate school, I graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and worked as an academic advisor. Outside of research, I spend as much time as possible with my daughter, wife, and two golden retrievers (Leslie and Perkins). I am a huge Wisconsin sports fan, having been born and raised in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and am an avid fan of the Green Bay Packers, Wisconsin Badgers, Milwaukee Bucks. I am a die-hard fan of Chelsea Football Club and happily spend my (very early) Saturday mornings watching them play.  <p>
